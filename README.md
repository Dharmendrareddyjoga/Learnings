REST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of architectural principles that define how web services can be designed to be scalable, stateless, and can be cached, among other things. These services, often called RESTful services, are commonly used in web applications for handling the CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, Delete - on the server side.

Here's a more detailed example of how REST services might be used in a real-world application:

Let's say you're building a web application for a library. The application needs to handle operations like adding new books, retrieving information about books, updating book details, and deleting books. For this, you could create a RESTful service with the following endpoints:

POST /books: Adds a new book to the library. The details of the book are sent in the body of the POST request. This corresponds to the "Create" operation in CRUD.

GET /books: Retrieves a list of all books in the library. This corresponds to the "Read" operation in CRUD.

GET /books/{id}: Retrieves information about a specific book, identified by its ID. This is also part of the "Read" operation in CRUD.

PUT /books/{id}: Updates the details of a specific book, identified by its ID. The new details are sent in the body of the PUT request. This corresponds to the "Update" operation in CRUD.

DELETE /books/{id}: Deletes a specific book, identified by its ID. This corresponds to the "Delete" operation in CRUD.

Each of these endpoints would be implemented as a function on the server side. When the server receives a request at one of these endpoints, it would execute the corresponding function.

For example, when the server receives a POST /books request, it would execute the function for adding a new book. This function would take the book details from the request, add the book to the library's database, and return a response indicating whether the operation was successful.

This is a simplified example, but it gives you an idea of how RESTful services are used in real-world applications. In a real application, you would also need to handle things like input validation, error handling, authentication, and more.
